"""
Below piece of code shows, how to get all the files name and create same files with appending "out" into another folder.
Basic use of this piece of code to get input data from a folder rather than files. 
Pre requisite:
1. Input folder should be there 
2. Output folder should be present where we will create our output files.
"""

    print(file)

    out_file_rename = "Output/"+ out_file + "_out." + ext
    print(out_file)
    w_file = open(out_file_rename, 'w')
    w_file.close()
